    <h1>Roosevelt High School is hosting an open amateur track meet.</h1>
    <p>Anyone is welcome to join. Participate in our joggers mile. Everyone writes down their time at
    the beginning, no one is allowed to wear a watch during the race and the person
    who finishes closest to their estimated time takes home a pie!</p>
